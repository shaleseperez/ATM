# ATM üèßüíµ

### This is a React app that functions like an ATM
The ATM app has basic 'Deposit' and 'Withdrawal' features. It also tracks and updates your available balance as you make transactions.

### How to Run
* Download the zip and extract the files (Or fork the repository and fetch the files)
* Open the console and navigate to the downloaded folder. Run the following commands: `npm install --global http-server` (if you do not have it installed) and then `http-server -c-1` to start the server
* Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
* Select either 'Deposit' or 'Withrawal' and click submit to complete your transaction. Complete multiple transactions to watch the 'Available Balance' update. *(You should not be able to overdraw the account)*
